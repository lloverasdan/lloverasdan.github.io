### Welcome!

This is my new webpage, and is currently under construction. For my current UW-affiliated webpage, visit [this link](https://atmos.uw.edu/~lloveras/).

### About me

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington. My research deals with atmospheric predictability, specifically focusing on the initial-condition errors that lead to poor forecasts of midlatitude cyclones. I use WRF simulations of both idealized and real-world cyclones to conduct my experiments. My advisor is Professor Dale Durran.
I completed my MS at the University of Washington in 2021. For my MS thesis, I compared initial-condition-error growth in idealized midlatitude cyclones with that of homogeneous, isotropic turbulence, which is the context in which Lorenz observed the "butterfly effect".
I completed my BS at the University of Miami in 2018. For my senior thesis, I investigated the effect of shortwave-absorbing smoke particles on low-cloud cover over the southeast Atlantic Ocean. I also completed a summer research internship at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, where I studied the predictability of summertime precipitation over the southeastern United States.
